         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That the King mu≈øt command not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods, but Mans Law al≈øo.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That if he doe not ≈øo command, the re≈øi≈øtance is not a re≈øi≈øtance of power, but will.</p>

               <hi>3.</hi> That to ≈øay ≈øuch a re≈øi≈øtance mu≈øt be but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defen≈øive, is non-≈øen≈øe, for ≈øo a man may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øting ever, and never, re≈øi≈øt like the filly women of whom the Apo≈øtle ≈øayes, they are ever learning and never attaine to the Truth.</p>
            <p>The Second is an Historicall; they conceive and ≈øay, Never ≈øuch times, ≈øuch Taxations, ≈øuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, ≈øuch a warre, &amp;c. Never? Sure you erre much in point of Hi≈øtory, the twentyeth part, fifteenth part,

            <p>And <hi>2.</hi> Whether they had rather part with it to the Parliament, or that and their lives too, to the Cavaliers?</p>
            <p>The third is a Legall con≈øideration: Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions J would make to our Malignants skilled in the Law, which ≈øhall be the≈øe: <hi>1.</hi> whether I had better tru≈øt to another mans favour, or to mine owne ≈øtrength for my defence?

               <note place="margin">Ari≈øt.</note> Heathens tell us that the wi≈øe mu≈øt give a≈ømuch to the Law as may be, but to the Lawgiver as little; for (≈øaies he) he is a man ≈øubject to pa≈øsions, may be mi≈øcarryed, &amp;c. <hi>4.</hi> The Law is the common ≈øurety betweene the King and the Subject, that is to ≈øay, it bindes me to pay the King Tribute, &amp;c. and binds the King that J ≈øhall enjoy my protection. <hi>5.</hi> In a word, he is a good Subject that lookes up ward to ≈øee what, in God, Gods Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent commandeth; and ≈øecondly, that lookes downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ≈øee whom the obedience thereunto doth either hurt or hinder.

               <p>But let us ≈øee the parts of the Kings chiding:</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, His blame is plainely laid downe: <hi>David</hi> was a very happy King here, in the plaine dealing of <hi>Joab,</hi> el≈øewhere in <hi>Nathan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Kings are not more unhappy in any thing, then this, their flatterers and fal≈øifyers with their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, reward hearing.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:155760:15"/>
               <p>But is it true that <hi>Joab</hi> charges the King withal?</p>
               <p>The Lord forbid that anything but truth ≈øhould be charged upon the Lords Anointed. Then for An≈øwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Simply and by it ≈øelfe, <hi>David</hi> really hated to ≈øhame them that pre≈øerve him and his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But it is by accident thus: as if <hi>Joab</hi> had ≈øaid, Sir, I perceive there are in your heart two things, in great competition, ≈øtriving for preheminence, your <hi>Ab≈øolom</hi> fir≈øt, and then your People. Now becau≈øe he hath gotten ≈øo much of your heart, therefore we get ≈øo little. And thus <hi>Joabs</hi> charge is true laid to the King; and thus may the Subjects charge again≈øt the King be true, if lying under the like cau≈øe of complaint.</p>
               <p>But the ≈øecond part is <hi>Joabs</hi> Demon≈øtration, <hi>In that thou love≈øt thine enemies, and hate≈øt thy Friends:</hi> Is this tiue? Yes, with this qualification;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Negatively, I doe not ≈øay alwayes you doe ≈øo, but in this particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not in all particulars neither, but in particulars of
<note n="*" place="margin">No mi≈øerv greater to us in this ≈øad time then this, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with Barbari≈øme, purity with popery, he lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath ≈øtore of carnall men for it, for they love it, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ≈øeene and loved of few, &amp; therefore of few imbraced</note> competition, <hi>q.d. Joab;</hi> Sir your <hi>Ab≈øolom</hi> and your <hi>Adonijah,</hi> you may love them wel, but not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then your own peace, your owne people. If the Queene of your bo≈øome ≈øtand in competition with your Kingdome, your people, you mu≈øt not love her better then us, then it: <hi>Sapientia optime cernitur in comparatis.</hi> I conclude this with a Hi≈øtory I have read: the Emperour
<note n="*" place="margin">Turk. hi≈øtory.</note> was charged with defect and want of care in government, by his Nobles and Princes moved thereto (as they alledged) by the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:155760:15"/>too much love of a Lady his Concubine: Whom in a great a≈ø≈øembly the Emperour ≈øhewed to all his people on a time, and they concluded that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of her excellent beauty, they could not blame him for being mi≈øled by her, and ≈øo were conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But (≈øaith he) that you may know how little I regard her in compari≈øon of you, he drew his cemyter and kild her before them all. If our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion had ≈øtood in competition with any thing but Popery, our Parliament with any thing but the Gentry and Delinquents, they had never been ≈øo neare a mi≈øcarriage.</p>
               <p>But the third part is <hi>Joabs</hi> humble reque≈øt: <hi>Now therefore, &amp;c.</hi> It is in a triplicity:</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>Surge,</hi> you are falne Sir very low, a King of others and not of your ≈øelfe, how ≈øhall you rule their pa≈ø≈øions that cannot guide your owne?</p>

               <p>And the fourth part is <hi>Davids</hi> great danger, if this be not done, <hi>viz.</hi> the Peoples de≈øertion.</p>
               <p>But who ≈øhall apply this? Who may? Who dare?</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Let it be applyed to our <hi>David,</hi> and tell

               <p>Secondly, And take heed you ≈øpeake our ≈øen≈øe. We doe not

               <p>Thirdly, And let this be done dutifully, humbly, in a Subjects po≈øture, and as to a <hi>David</hi> indeed.</p>
